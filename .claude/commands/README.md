# MeshMonitor Custom Claude Code Commands

This directory contains custom slash commands for Claude Code to streamline MeshMonitor development workflows.

## What Are Custom Commands?

Custom commands are reusable prompt templates that become available through the `/` slash menu in Claude Code. They can:
- Automate repetitive workflows
- Standardize common tasks
- Accept parameters via `$ARGUMENTS`
- Be shared across the team via git

## Available Commands

### /worktree
**Create a git worktree with automatic setup**

Creates a new git worktree for parallel development, sets up dependencies, and optionally opens a new terminal.

**Usage:**
```bash
/worktree emoji reactions
/worktree websocket bug fix
/worktree update api docs
```

**What it does:**
1. Converts task name to kebab-case
2. Determines branch type (feature/fix/docs)
3. Creates worktree in peer directory
4. Runs `npm install`
5. Initializes git submodules
6. Copies .env file
7. Reports next steps

**Example:**
```bash
/worktree message search

# Creates:
# - Worktree: ../meshmonitor-message-search
# - Branch: feature/message-search
# - Runs setup automatically
```

---

### /create-pr
**Create or update a pull request with full validation**

Runs the complete PR workflow: unit tests, TypeScript check, documentation review, detailed PR creation, and CI feedback monitoring.

**Usage:**
```bash
/create-pr                           # Create new PR for current branch
/create-pr Fixes the Invalid Date bug on PostgreSQL
/create-pr 2297                      # Update existing PR #2297
```

**What it does:**
1. Runs unit tests and TypeScript check
2. Reviews internal and website documentation for accuracy
3. Creates branch and pushes if needed
4. Creates PR with detailed description (intent, changes, issues, testing steps)
5. Waits 5 minutes for CI, then reviews feedback
6. Fixes urgent findings automatically, prompts for non-urgent ones

---

### /worktree-cleanup
**Clean up merged worktrees and branches**

Removes worktrees that have been merged into main and deletes their associated branches.

**Usage:**
```bash
/worktree-cleanup
```

**What it does:**
1. Lists all worktrees
2. Identifies merged branches
3. Asks for confirmation
4. Removes merged worktrees
5. Deletes merged branches
6. Prunes stale references
7. Reports summary

**Safety features:**
- Never removes main worktree
- Warns about uncommitted changes
- Asks for confirmation before deleting
- Provides dry-run information

## Installation

### Project-Level (Recommended for MeshMonitor)
Commands are already in `.claude/commands/` and committed to git:
```bash
# They're already here!
.claude/commands/
├── README.md
├── worktree.md
└── worktree-cleanup.md
```

When you run `claude` in the meshmonitor directory, these commands are automatically available.

### User-Level (Personal Commands)
For personal commands you want across all projects:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
cp your-command.md ~/.claude/commands/
```

## Using Commands

### In Claude Code Session
```bash
claude

# Type / to see available commands
> /

# Available commands:
# /worktree - Create git worktree
# /worktree-cleanup - Clean up merged worktrees
# ... (other commands)

# Use with arguments
> /worktree emoji reactions

# Or without arguments (interactive)
> /worktree-cleanup
```

### From Command Line
```bash
# Non-interactive mode
claude --print "/worktree message-threading"

# Continue previous session with command
claude --continue --print "/worktree-cleanup"
```

## Creating Your Own Commands

### Basic Template
Create `.claude/commands/my-command.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-command
description: Brief description of what this command does
---

Main prompt template goes here.

You can use $ARGUMENTS to accept parameters.

## Examples
Show usage examples here.
```

### With Arguments
```markdown
---
name: fix-issue
description: Analyze and fix a GitHub issue
---

Analyze and fix GitHub issue: $ARGUMENTS

Steps:
1. Use `gh issue view $ARGUMENTS` to get details
2. Search codebase for relevant files
3. Implement the fix
4. Create tests
5. Commit and create PR
```

Usage: `/fix-issue 123`

### Best Practices

1. **Clear descriptions** - Help Claude know when to suggest the command
2. **Structured prompts** - Use numbered steps or sections
3. **Examples included** - Show expected usage
4. **Error handling** - Account for common failure cases
5. **MeshMonitor-specific** - Reference our context files

### MeshMonitor Command Template
```markdown
---
name: command-name
description: When to use this command
---

Brief overview of what this command does for MeshMonitor.

## Context
Reference relevant .claude/*.md files:
- Read .claude/architecture-notes.md for system context
- Follow .claude/testing-guide.md for test patterns
- Use .claude/pr-prep.md for commit standards

## Steps
1. First step
2. Second step
3. ...

## MeshMonitor-Specific Considerations
- TCP protocol patterns
- Catppuccin Mocha theme
- SQLite database
- Test requirements (100% pass)
- Conventional commits

## Examples
Show usage examples specific to MeshMonitor.

## Error Handling
Account for common MeshMonitor-specific issues.
```

## Command Ideas for MeshMonitor

Consider creating commands for:

### /implement-feature
Full feature implementation workflow:
- Plan with tests first
- Implement incrementally
- Run tests after each chunk
- Update docs
- Review before PR

### /fix-bug
Systematic bug fixing:
- Reproduce the issue
- Create failing test
- Fix the bug
- Verify test passes
- Add regression test

### /update-docs
Documentation updates:
- Update README for features
- Add API documentation
- Update environment variables
- Create PR description

### /release-prep
Prepare for release:
- Run full test suite
- Build Docker image
- Update changelog
- Tag version
- Create release notes

## Integration with Subagents

Commands can invoke subagents:

```markdown
---
name: full-review
description: Complete PR review workflow
---

Comprehensive PR review for MeshMonitor:

1. Use meshmonitor-test-generator to verify test coverage
2. Use meshmonitor-pr-reviewer to check standards
3. Use meshmonitor-docs-writer to verify documentation
4. Provide final go/no-go recommendation

Report findings in structured format.
```

## Testing Commands

### Test Locally
```bash
claude
> /my-command test-arg

# Verify:
# - Does it understand $ARGUMENTS?
# - Does it execute the right steps?
# - Does it handle errors gracefully?
```

### Iterate
Commands are just markdown files - edit and retry:
```bash
# Edit
vim .claude/commands/my-command.md

# Restart Claude to reload
exit
claude
> /my-command
```

## Sharing Commands

### With Team
Commands in `.claude/commands/` are committed to git:
```bash
git add .claude/commands/new-command.md
git commit -m "chore: add /new-command for X workflow"
git push
```

Team members get them automatically:
```bash
git pull
claude  # Commands now available
```

### With Community
Share useful patterns:
1. Create gist or repo
2. Document clearly
3. Link from README
4. Accept contributions

## Commands vs. Subagents

**Use Commands when:**
- Workflow is procedural (step 1, 2, 3...)
- Need to invoke multiple subagents
- Templating repetitive prompts
- Automating git operations

**Use Subagents when:**
- Task needs independent context
- Specialized expertise required
- Running in parallel
- Complex reasoning needed

**Use Both:**
Commands can orchestrate subagents for powerful workflows!

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Showing in Menu
```bash
# Check file location
ls .claude/commands/

# Check YAML frontmatter
head .claude/commands/my-command.md

# Restart Claude
exit
claude
```

### $ARGUMENTS Not Working
```markdown
# Correct usage
"Process task: $ARGUMENTS"

# Incorrect
"Process task: {ARGUMENTS}"
"Process task: %ARGUMENTS%"
```

### Command Doesn't Do What Expected
- Review the prompt template
- Add more specific instructions
- Test with different arguments
- Check error handling

**Pro Tip:** Start with the provided `/worktree` and `/worktree-cleanup` commands, then create more as you discover repetitive workflows. The best commands emerge from real usage patterns!
