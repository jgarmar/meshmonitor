# TODO List

## Current Sprint

### MQTT Traceroute Visualization (#893)

**Completed:**
- [x] Add overlay0 color to ThemeColors interface (useTraceroutePaths.tsx)
- [x] Update App.tsx to include overlay0 in theme colors
- [x] Track MQTT segments (SNR = 0.0 dB indicates MQTT traversal)
- [x] Render MQTT segments with dotted line and different color (overlay0)
- [x] Add "via MQTT" indicator badge to route segment popup
- [x] Update useMemo dependency array for themeColors.overlay0
- [x] TypeScript typecheck passed
- [x] Unit tests passed (81 test files, 1784 tests)
- [x] Build successful

**Summary:**
Traceroute segments that report 0.0 dB SNR (indicating MQTT traversal) are now rendered differently on the map. MQTT segments display as dotted lines in a muted gray color (overlay0 from Catppuccin theme) with reduced opacity. The route segment popup also shows a "via MQTT" badge for these segments.

### Infinite Scroll for Messages (#853)

**Completed:**
- [x] Add offset parameter to `getMessagesByChannel` in database.ts
- [x] Add offset parameter to `getDirectMessages` in database.ts
- [x] Add offset query parameter to `/api/messages/channel/:channel` endpoint
- [x] Add offset query parameter to `/api/messages/direct/:nodeId1/:nodeId2` endpoint
- [x] Add `getChannelMessages` and `getDirectMessages` API client functions
- [x] Add pagination state to DataContext (channelHasMore, channelLoadingMore, dmHasMore, dmLoadingMore)
- [x] Implement `isScrolledNearTop` detection in App.tsx
- [x] Implement `loadMoreChannelMessages` with scroll position preservation
- [x] Implement `loadMoreDirectMessages` with scroll position preservation
- [x] Add loading indicator UI for both channel and DM views
- [x] Add CSS styles for loading spinner animation
- [x] Docker build successful
- [x] TypeScript type check passed
- [x] Unit tests passed

**In Progress:**
- [x] System tests passed (7/7)

**Summary:**
Implemented infinite scroll for both channel messages and direct messages. When users scroll to the top of a message list, older messages are automatically loaded from the database. Scroll position is preserved so users don't experience a jump when new messages are prepended. Loading indicator shows while fetching.
