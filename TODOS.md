# TODO List

## Future Work (from v3.0 PR Review)

### Database Performance & Configuration

- [ ] **Connection pool configuration** - Make pool size configurable via environment variables (default 10 may be too low for high-traffic deployments) - `src/db/drivers/postgres.ts:43`, `src/db/drivers/mysql.ts:48`
- [ ] **Large migration batching** - Add batch processing for large tables (e.g., 1000 rows at a time) to prevent memory issues - `src/cli/migrate-db.ts:579`
- [ ] **Database index strategy** - Document and add indexes for commonly queried columns (nodeNum, messageId, etc.) for PostgreSQL/MySQL performance

### Error Handling & Recovery

- [ ] **Database driver reconnection** - Implement reconnection logic for transient failures (current pool error handlers only log) - `src/db/drivers/postgres.ts:74`, `src/db/drivers/mysql.ts:82`
- [ ] **Migration rollback mechanism** - Add transaction support or backup verification before migration to handle partial failures - `src/cli/migrate-db.ts`

### Schema & Type Safety

- [x] **Boolean type consistency** - Fixed `positionOverrideEnabled` and `positionOverrideIsPrivate` to use proper boolean types across all schemas (SQLite mode:'boolean', PostgreSQL pgBoolean, MySQL myBoolean). Added migration 047 to convert existing INTEGER columns to BOOLEAN.
- [x] **BIGINT coercion type guards** - Fixed `normalizeBigInts` to preserve prototype chains for Date objects and other special types using `Object.getPrototypeOf()` and `Object.create()`.
- [x] **Dynamic sequence names** - Replaced hardcoded sequence list with dynamic discovery using `pg_get_serial_sequence()` to find all sequences owned by table columns.

### Security

- [ ] **CLI credential handling** - Support environment variable or config file input for database credentials (command line args visible in process lists) - `src/cli/migrate-db.ts:314`

### Testing

- [ ] **Integration tests** - Add integration tests for actual PostgreSQL/MySQL connections
- [ ] **Migration error scenarios** - Add comprehensive error scenario testing for migration tool
- [ ] **Performance testing** - Add performance testing for large dataset scenarios
- [ ] **Database benchmarking** - Create performance benchmarking for different database backends

## Current Sprint

### Remote Admin Telemetry Configuration (#1589)

**Completed:**
- [x] Add TelemetryConfigState interface to useAdminCommandsState.ts
  - 10 telemetry configuration fields (device interval, environment, air quality, power)
  - SET_TELEMETRY_CONFIG action type and reducer case
  - setTelemetryConfig callback function
- [x] Add telemetry section to ModuleConfigurationSection.tsx
  - Device Telemetry: update interval
  - Environment Telemetry: enabled, interval, screen display, Fahrenheit
  - Advanced Settings (collapsible): Air Quality and Power metrics
- [x] Wire telemetry in AdminCommandsTab.tsx
  - Add telemetry to sectionLoadStatus initial state
  - handleTelemetryConfigChange and handleSetTelemetryConfig callbacks
  - Case for loading telemetry config in handleLoadSingleConfig
  - Pass telemetry props to ModuleConfigurationSection
- [x] Add setTelemetryConfig case to server.ts admin/commands endpoint
- [x] Add telemetry (config type 5) to moduleConfigMap in meshtasticManager.ts
- [x] Add telemetry_config_short translation key to en.json
- [x] Build successful, TypeScript check passed

**Summary:**
Added Telemetry Configuration section to the Admin Commands tab's Module Configuration area. Users can now remotely configure device metrics interval, environment sensors (enabled, interval, screen, Fahrenheit), air quality metrics, and power metrics for remote nodes.

### Channel-Based Node Visibility (Discussion #1503)

**Completed:**
- [x] Add `filterNodesByChannelPermission` helper function to nodeEnhancer.ts
  - Filters nodes based on user's channel read permissions
  - Admin users see all nodes
  - Uses `channel_0` through `channel_7` read permissions
  - Handles null/undefined users (anonymous without permissions)
- [x] Update `/api/nodes` endpoint to filter nodes by channel permission
- [x] Update `/api/nodes/active` endpoint to filter nodes by channel permission
- [x] Update `/api/bulk` (poll) endpoint to filter nodes by channel permission
- [x] Update `/api/messages/unread-counts` to filter DM node list
- [x] Update `/api/telemetry/available/nodes` to filter node telemetry availability
- [x] Update `/api/v1/nodes` endpoint to filter nodes by channel permission
- [x] Update `/api/v1/nodes/:nodeId` to check channel permission for single node
- [x] Add unit tests for `filterNodesByChannelPermission` function
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes
- [x] Unit tests pass (12 tests in nodeEnhancer.test.ts)

**Summary:**
Extended the permission system so that channel read permissions (`channel_0:read` through `channel_7:read`) now control node visibility. Each node has a `channel` field indicating which channel it was last heard on. Users without read permission for a node's channel will not see that node in any API response. This works for Session auth, API token auth, and Anonymous users.

---

### Script Metadata Enhancement (#1490)

**Completed:**
- [x] Add script metadata parsing to /api/scripts endpoint
  - Parse `mm_meta:` blocks from script files
  - Extract name, emoji, and language fields
  - Auto-detect language from file extension as fallback
- [x] Update TimerTriggersSection dropdown with enhanced display

### Auto Traceroute Settings Column Mismatch Fix

**Completed:**
- [x] Identified column name mismatch causing 500 error on `/api/settings/traceroute-nodes`
  - SQLite migration 015 created `auto_traceroute_nodes` table with `addedAt` column
  - Drizzle schema and PostgreSQL/MySQL used `createdAt` column
  - Caused async repo queries to fail for SQLite
- [x] Added migration 048 to rename `addedAt` to `createdAt` in SQLite
- [x] Updated sync methods in `database.ts` to use `createdAt` instead of `addedAt`
- [x] Build successful

**Summary:**
Fixed a bug where Auto Traceroute settings page returned 500 error because of a column name mismatch between the SQLite migration (`addedAt`) and the Drizzle schema (`createdAt`). This prevented the UI from loading initial settings, so the "Save Changes" button never became enabled.

---

### PostgreSQL Read Tracking Fix

**Completed:**
- [x] Add mark-as-read methods to NotificationsRepository (markChannelMessagesAsRead, markDMMessagesAsRead, markAllDMMessagesAsRead, markMessagesAsReadByIds)
- [x] Update database.ts to call async repo methods for PostgreSQL/MySQL instead of returning 0
- [x] Build and deploy to Docker container

**Summary:**
Fixed a bug where unread message indicators wouldn't clear when viewing channels/DMs on PostgreSQL databases. The mark-as-read functions were returning 0 immediately for PostgreSQL/MySQL with "not yet implemented" comments. Added proper implementations using raw SQL for efficient INSERT...SELECT operations with ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING.

---

### Server Start Notification Timing Fix

**Completed:**
- [x] Identified timing bug: server start notification sent before PostgreSQL database fully initialized
- [x] Added `await databaseService.waitForReady()` before sending server start notification
- [x] Wrapped notification code in async IIFE with error handling
- [x] Build and deploy to Docker container

**Summary:**
Fixed a bug where server start notifications (via Apprise/Pushover) weren't being sent to PostgreSQL users. The notification was being sent before the database was fully initialized, so the query for users with `notifyOnServerEvents` enabled returned 0 results. Now the notification waits for the database to be ready.

### Remote Admin LoRa Config Missing txEnabled Fields (#1328)

**Completed:**
- [x] Add txEnabled, overrideDutyCycle, paFanDisabled to LoRaConfigState interface
- [x] Add defaults to initial state (txEnabled: true to prevent accidental TX disable)
- [x] Update setLoRaConfig calls when loading config from remote node
- [x] Update handleSetLoRaConfig to include the new fields when saving
- [x] Add UI controls for txEnabled, overrideDutyCycle, paFanDisabled in Remote Admin
- [x] Add translation keys for new settings

**Summary:**
Fixed a bug where saving Remote Admin LoRa configuration would silently disable transmission (txEnabled=false). The issue was that txEnabled, overrideDutyCycle, and paFanDisabled were missing from the Remote Admin LoRa state, causing protobuf to default boolean fields to false when saving. Added all three fields to the state interface, load callbacks, save handler, and UI.

- [x] Update existing incoming packet logging with direction: 'rx'
- [x] Update PacketLog type definition with direction field
- [x] Update Packet Monitor UI with direction indicator column (TX/RX)
- [x] Add CSS styles for direction indicators (green RX, orange TX)
- [x] Add translation keys for direction column and tooltips

**Summary:**
Users can now see outgoing mesh commands (text messages, traceroutes, position/nodeinfo exchanges, and remote admin commands) in the Packet Monitor. A new "Dir" column displays TX (transmitted) or RX (received) with color coding. Local IP commands to the node (like wantConfig) are intentionally not logged.

- [x] Ensure LN4CY attribution throughout (credit in docker-compose, docs, UI)

**Summary:**
Integrated [LN4CY's MQTT Proxy](https://github.com/LN4CY/mqtt-proxy) as an optional Docker sidecar. The proxy routes MQTT traffic through MeshMonitor's Virtual Node instead of the node's WiFi, providing more reliable connectivity for nodes with poor WiFi (T-Deck, portable devices) or Serial/BLE connections.

### Node List Filter on Messages Page (#1185)

**Completed:**
- [x] Add new filter options to Messages page dropdown
  - "By Hops (Nearest First)" - sorts by hop count ascending, ignores favorites
  - "Favorites Only" - shows only favorite nodes, sorted by hops
  - "With Position" - shows only nodes with valid GPS position, sorted by hops
  - "Exclude Infrastructure" - hides Router, Repeater, Router Client, Router Late roles, sorted by hops
- [x] Add `isInfrastructureNode()` helper function to nodeHelpers.ts (roles 2, 3, 4, 11)
- [x] Add `hasValidPosition()` helper function to nodeHelpers.ts
- [x] Update dmFilter type in UIContext.tsx to include new filter values

### Replace GPL-licensed Session Store (#1177)

**Priority: HIGH** - License compatibility issue

The `better-sqlite3-session-store` package is GPL-3.0-only licensed, which conflicts with MeshMonitor's BSD-3-Clause license. This is actual code being imported and linked, not just data definitions.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Write custom SQLite session store using `better-sqlite3` (MIT licensed)
- [ ] Implement express-session Store interface: `get`, `set`, `destroy`, `touch`
- [ ] Add session cleanup for expired sessions
- [ ] Remove `better-sqlite3-session-store` dependency
- [ ] Update `src/server/auth/sessionConfig.ts` to use new store
- [ ] Test session persistence across restarts
- [ ] Run system tests

**Reference:** The existing store is ~72 lines. We already use `better-sqlite3` directly (MIT licensed).

- [x] Create webSocketService.ts - Socket.io server initialization
  - Share Express session for authentication
  - Respect BASE_URL for socket.io path
- [x] Modify server.ts to initialize WebSocket after HTTP server starts
- [x] Add event emissions to meshtasticManager.ts at key data insertion points

  - Emit routing updates for ACK/NAK delivery status
- [x] Create useWebSocket.ts - client hook for WebSocket connection
  - Automatically update TanStack Query cache when events received
  - Handle reconnection and error states
- [x] Create WebSocketContext.tsx - React context for WebSocket state
  - Only enable WebSocket when user is authenticated
- [x] Modify usePoll.ts for hybrid polling
  - Poll every 30 seconds when WebSocket connected (backup)
  - Poll every 5 seconds when WebSocket disconnected (real-time fallback)
- [x] Modify App.tsx to integrate WebSocket
  - Add WebSocketProvider in main.tsx
  - Pass webSocketConnected to usePoll
- [x] Add WebSocket/polling status indicator to AppHeader
- [x] TypeScript compilation successful
- [x] Build successful (client + server)
- [x] All 7 system tests passed

**Summary:**
Implemented Socket.io WebSocket support for real-time mesh data updates. When the WebSocket is connected, the polling interval is reduced from 5 seconds to 30 seconds as real-time updates come via WebSocket. Events are emitted when messages, nodes, channels, or connection status change. Telemetry updates are batched to reduce traffic. Falls back to frequent polling when WebSocket is disconnected.

- [x] Update useMemo dependency array for themeColors.overlay0
- [x] TypeScript typecheck passed
- [x] Unit tests passed (81 test files, 1784 tests)
- [x] Build successful

**Summary:**
Traceroute segments that report 0.0 dB SNR (indicating MQTT traversal) are now rendered differently on the map. MQTT segments display as dotted lines in a muted gray color (overlay0 from Catppuccin theme) with reduced opacity. The route segment popup also shows a "via MQTT" badge for these segments.

### Infinite Scroll for Messages (#853)

**Completed:**
- [x] Add offset parameter to `getMessagesByChannel` in database.ts
- [x] Add offset parameter to `getDirectMessages` in database.ts

- [x] TypeScript type check passed
- [x] Unit tests passed

**In Progress:**
- [x] System tests passed (7/7)

**Summary:**
Implemented infinite scroll for both channel messages and direct messages. When users scroll to the top of a message list, older messages are automatically loaded from the database. Scroll position is preserved so users don't experience a jump when new messages are prepended. Loading indicator shows while fetching.
