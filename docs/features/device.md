## LoRa Radio Configuration

### Use Preset

**Description**: Enable or disable using predefined modem configurations.

**Recommendation**: Keep enabled unless you have specific requirements for custom settings.

**Effect**: When enabled, modem parameters (bandwidth, spreading factor, coding rate) are set automatically based on the selected preset.

**Side Effects**: Disabling requires manual configuration of advanced LoRa parameters

::: warning Advanced Configuration
When "Use Preset" is disabled, you must manually configure bandwidth, spreading factor, and coding rate. Incorrect settings can prevent communication with other nodes or violate regulatory requirements. Only disable presets if you have specific technical requirements and understand LoRa modulation parameters.
:::

### Manual LoRa Parameters

These parameters are only available when "Use Preset" is disabled. They provide fine-grained control over radio modulation for advanced users.

#### Bandwidth

**Description**: Channel bandwidth in kHz, which determines the frequency range used for transmission.

**Range**: 31-500 kHz

**Common Values**:
- 31 (31.25 kHz) - Narrowest, best interference resistance
- 125 kHz - Good balance
- 250 kHz - Most common, used by all standard presets
- 500 kHz - Widest, highest data rate

**Effect**: Wider bandwidth = faster data rate but more susceptible to interference. Narrower bandwidth = slower data rate but better sensitivity and interference resistance.

**Side Effects**:
- All nodes must use the same bandwidth to communicate
- Wider bandwidths may violate duty cycle regulations in some regions
- Affects battery life (wider = more power)

**Best Practices**:
- Use 250 kHz for most deployments (matches all standard presets)
- Only change if you have specific range or speed requirements
- Verify regulatory compliance for your region

#### Spreading Factor

**Description**: Number of chirps per symbol, which determines how the signal is spread across time.

**Range**: 7-12

**Effect**: Higher spreading factor = longer range but slower data rate. Each increment doubles range but halves speed.

**Common Configurations**:
- SF7: Shortest range, fastest speed (5.47 kbps @ 125kHz)
- SF9: Medium range (SHORT presets)
- SF10: Good range (MEDIUM presets)
- SF11: Long range (LONG presets)
- SF12: Maximum range, slowest speed (293 bps @ 125kHz)

**Side Effects**:
- Higher SF = longer airtime = more battery usage
- Higher SF = more susceptible to frequency drift
- All nodes must use the same SF to communicate
- Different SFs are orthogonal (can coexist without interference)

**Best Practices**:
- Start with SF11 (LONG_FAST default) for most deployments
- Increase to SF12 only for extreme range requirements
- Lower to SF7-9 for dense local networks

#### Coding Rate

**Description**: Denominator of the forward error correction (FEC) coding rate.

**Range**: 5-8

**Format**: Coding rate is 4/N where N is the value you set (5-8)

**Common Values**:
- 5 (4/5): Lightest error correction, fastest speed
- 6 (4/6): Light error correction
- 7 (4/7): Moderate error correction
- 8 (4/8): Heaviest error correction, most robust

**Effect**: Higher coding rate (larger denominator) = more error correction overhead but better resistance to interference.

**Side Effects**:
- Higher coding rate = longer airtime = more battery usage
- Higher coding rate = slower effective data rate
- All nodes must use the same coding rate to communicate

**Best Practices**:
- Use 8 (4/8) for long-range or noisy environments (LONG_FAST default)
- Use 5 (4/5) for clean, short-range links (SHORT_FAST)
- Most presets use 8 for maximum reliability

#### Frequency Offset

**Description**: Fine-tuning frequency offset in MHz for crystal calibration and drift compensation.

**Range**: Typically ±0.5 MHz

**Default**: 0

**Effect**: Adjusts the transmission frequency by a small amount to compensate for crystal oscillator inaccuracies.

**Use Cases**:
- Compensating for temperature drift
- Correcting known crystal frequency errors
- Fine-tuning for optimal performance with specific hardware

**Side Effects**:
- Incorrect offset can prevent communication
- Should only be changed if you've measured a frequency error
- Most devices do not require adjustment

**Best Practices**:
- Leave at 0 unless you have a specific reason to change it
- Only adjust if you've used test equipment to measure frequency error
- Very rarely needed with modern hardware

**Use Cases**:
- Integration with systems that expect JSON
- Easier debugging and monitoring
- Home automation systems

**Side Effects**: Larger message size compared to protobuf

### TLS Enabled

**Description**: Enable TLS/SSL encryption for the MQTT connection.

**Recommendation**: Always enable for public/internet MQTT brokers.

**Effect**: Encrypts all MQTT traffic between the device and broker.

**Side Effects**: Slightly higher power usage due to encryption overhead.

### MQTT Root Topic

**Description**: Base topic for MQTT messages.

**Default**: `msh/`

**Effect**: Customizes the MQTT topic hierarchy.

**Use Cases**: Running multiple independent mesh networks on same MQTT broker

### Proxy to Client (Client Proxy Mode)

**Description**: Route MQTT traffic through a connected client application instead of directly from the node's WiFi.

**Effect**: Instead of the node connecting directly to the MQTT broker, it sends MQTT packets to a connected client (mobile app, MeshMonitor, etc.) which then forwards them to the broker.

**Use Cases**:
- Nodes with unreliable WiFi (T-Deck, portable devices)
- Serial or BLE-connected nodes that don't have WiFi
- Centralized MQTT management through your server
- More reliable connectivity via Docker containers with health checks

::: tip MeshMonitor Integration
When using MeshMonitor, enable this option and deploy the [MQTT Client Proxy sidecar](/add-ons/mqtt-proxy). The proxy container handles all MQTT forwarding automatically.

:::

**How It Works**:
1. Node sends `mqttClientProxyMessage` to connected client
2. Client (MQTT Proxy) publishes message to MQTT broker
3. Client receives messages from broker and forwards to node
4. Same protocol used by official Meshtastic mobile apps

### Map Reporting

**Description**: Enable periodic location reporting to the MQTT map service.

**Effect**: Your node's position will be published to the configured MQTT broker for map display.

**Use Cases**: Integration with [meshmap.net](https://meshmap.net) or custom mapping solutions.

### Map Publish Interval

**Description**: How often to publish location updates to the map.

**Default**: 0 (use system default)

**Range**: 0-4294967295 seconds

### Map Position Precision

**Description**: Position precision for map reporting.

**Range**: 10-19 (higher = more precise)

**Privacy Note**: Lower precision values share less exact location data.

## Store and Forward Configuration

Configure the store-and-forward module to cache and replay messages for nodes that were offline.

### Enable Store and Forward

**Description**: Enable the store-and-forward module.

**Effect**: Device will cache messages and replay them to nodes that request missed messages.

**Use Cases**:
- Ensuring message delivery to intermittently connected nodes
- Mesh networks with mobile nodes
- Areas with unreliable coverage

### Is Server

**Description**: Configure this node as a store-and-forward server.

**Effect**: When enabled, this node actively stores messages and serves them to requesting clients.

**Best Practices**:
- Enable on powered, always-on nodes with good mesh coverage
- Only one or two servers needed per mesh network
- Choose nodes with stable power and central location

**Side Effects**: Increases memory usage and power consumption

### Heartbeat

**Description**: Send periodic heartbeat messages to indicate server availability.

**Effect**: Broadcasts server presence so clients know a store-and-forward server is available.

**Side Effects**: Adds periodic network traffic

### Records

**Description**: Maximum number of messages to store.

**Range**: 0-65535

**Effect**: Limits how many messages are kept in the cache.

**Best Practices**:
- Set based on available memory
- Higher values for longer offline periods
- Consider message size and available RAM

### History Return Max

**Description**: Maximum number of messages to return in a single history request.

**Range**: 0-255

**Effect**: Limits how many messages are sent at once when a client requests history.

**Best Practices**: Balance between completeness and network congestion

### History Return Window

**Description**: Maximum age of messages to return (in seconds).

**Range**: 0-86400 seconds (up to 24 hours)

**Effect**: Only returns messages newer than this time window.

**Best Practices**:
- Set based on typical offline duration
- Longer windows for nodes that go offline for extended periods
- Shorter windows reduce stale message replay

## Applying Changes

All configuration changes require clicking the "Save" button in each section. Most changes also require a device reboot to take effect. MeshMonitor will notify you when a reboot is required.

## Troubleshooting

### Configuration Not Saving

- Ensure you have a stable connection to the Meshtastic device
- Check that the device is powered and responsive
- Verify you have appropriate permissions

### Device Disconnected After Changes

- Some configuration changes (especially LoRa settings) may temporarily disconnect the device
- Wait 30-60 seconds for the device to reboot and reconnect
- If device doesn't reconnect, verify the configuration is compatible with your mesh network

### Can't Communicate After Region Change

- Ensure region matches other nodes in your mesh
- Verify the frequency is legal in your location
- Check that modem preset is compatible

## Device Configuration Backup

MeshMonitor provides comprehensive backup functionality that exports your complete device configuration in a format fully compatible with the official Meshtastic CLI `--export-config` command.

### What Gets Backed Up

The backup export includes your complete device configuration:

- **Device Settings**: Node identity, role, timezone, broadcast intervals
- **LoRa Radio**: Modem preset, region, bandwidth, spreading factor, coding rate, hop limit, TX power
- **Position**: GPS settings, broadcast intervals, smart position, fixed position coordinates
- **Power**: Battery management, sleep settings, shutdown behavior
- **Network**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth settings
- **Security**: Device keys (encrypted)
- **MQTT**: Broker settings, encryption, topics, credentials
- **Module Configuration**: All enabled modules (telemetry, neighbor info, canned messages, detection sensor, etc.)
- **Channel Configuration**: All channels with encryption keys (encoded in channel URL)

### Backup Features

#### Automated Backups

MeshMonitor can automatically create backups on a daily schedule:

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Backup**
2. Enable **Automated Backups**
3. Set your preferred backup time (UTC)
4. Configure retention (how many backups to keep)

Automated backups are stored in the `/data/backups/` directory with filenames in the format:
```
{nodeId}-{timestamp}.yaml
```

Example: `43588558-2025-10-28-12-34-18.yaml`

#### Manual Backups

To create an on-demand backup:

1. Navigate to the **Configuration** tab
2. Click the **Backup** button in the top-right corner
3. Choose whether to save to disk or just download
4. The backup file will be downloaded to your computer

### Backup File Format

Backups are saved in YAML format and are fully compatible with the official Meshtastic CLI. The format matches the output of:

```bash
meshtastic --export-config output.yaml
```

This means you can use MeshMonitor backups interchangeably with backups created by the official Meshtastic tools.

Example backup structure:

```yaml
# start of Meshtastic configure yaml
channel_url: https://meshtastic.org/e/#ChASAQE...
config:
  bluetooth:
    enabled: false
    fixedPin: 123456
  device:
    nodeInfoBroadcastSecs: 10800
    role: CLIENT_MUTE
    tzdef: EST5EDT,M3.2.0/2:00:00,M11.1.0/2:00:00
  lora:
    modemPreset: MEDIUM_FAST
    region: US
    hopLimit: 5
  position:
    fixedPosition: true
    positionBroadcastSecs: 1800
location:
  lat: 26.333431
  lon: -80.267695
  alt: 5.0
module_config:
  mqtt:
    enabled: true
    address: mqtt.example.com
owner: My Node Name
owner_short: MNN
```

### Restoring Configuration with Meshtastic CLI

You can restore a MeshMonitor backup to any Meshtastic device using the official Meshtastic CLI tools.

#### Prerequisites

1. Install the Meshtastic Python CLI:
   ```bash
   pip install meshtastic
   ```

2. Connect your device:
   - **USB/Serial**: Connect device via USB cable
   - **Network**: Ensure device is on same network
   - **Bluetooth**: Enable Bluetooth on your computer

#### Restore Process

**Using USB/Serial Connection:**

```bash
meshtastic --configure backup.yaml
```

The CLI will automatically detect your connected device and apply the configuration.

**Using Network Connection:**

```bash
meshtastic --host 192.168.1.100 --configure backup.yaml
```

Replace `192.168.1.100` with your device's IP address.

**Using Bluetooth:**

```bash
meshtastic --ble "Device Name" --configure backup.yaml
```

#### What Happens During Restore

When you restore a configuration:

1. **Device receives configuration**: All settings are sent to the device
2. **Channels are configured**: The channel URL is decoded and all channels are set up with encryption keys
3. **Device reboots**: The device automatically reboots to apply changes
4. **Settings take effect**: After reboot, device operates with restored configuration

::: warning Backup Encryption Keys
The backup includes your device's encryption keys and WiFi passwords. Store backup files securely and never share them publicly. Anyone with access to your backup file can decrypt messages from your mesh network and connect to your WiFi.
:::

### Restore Behavior

#### What Gets Overwritten

When restoring a backup, these settings are **completely replaced**:
- Device identity (names)
- LoRa radio settings
- All module configurations
- Channel settings and encryption keys
- WiFi and Bluetooth settings

#### What Doesn't Change

These items are **not affected** by restore:
- Device hardware model
- Firmware version
- MAC address
- Any locally stored messages or telemetry data

#### Partial Restore

You can manually edit the YAML backup file to restore only specific sections:

1. Open the backup file in a text editor
2. Delete the sections you don't want to restore
3. Save the modified file
4. Run the restore command

For example, to restore only LoRa settings, keep only the `config.lora` section.

### Best Practices

#### Regular Backups

- Enable automated backups to protect against configuration loss
- Create manual backups before making significant configuration changes
- Keep backups after firmware updates in case you need to rollback

#### Backup Storage

- Store backups in multiple locations (local computer, cloud storage, USB drive)
- Keep backups from different time periods (don't immediately delete old backups)
- Consider encrypting backups if storing in cloud services

#### Before Restoring

- Verify the backup file is for the correct device or a compatible model
- Review the backup contents to ensure it has the settings you want
- Make a backup of the current configuration before restoring
- Ensure the device has adequate power (battery or connected to power)

#### After Restoring

- Wait for the device to fully reboot (30-60 seconds)
- Verify critical settings like region and channel configuration
- Test connectivity with other mesh nodes
- Check that module configurations are working as expected

### Troubleshooting

#### Restore Fails or Hangs

- Ensure device is powered and responding
- Check USB cable connection quality
- Try using `--port /dev/ttyUSB0` (Linux/Mac) or `--port COM3` (Windows) to specify port
- Verify Python and meshtastic CLI are up to date:
  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade meshtastic
  ```

#### Device Won't Reconnect After Restore

- Wait 60-90 seconds for full reboot cycle
- If using WiFi, the restored WiFi settings may be different
- Try connecting via USB/serial instead
- Check if region settings are compatible with your local regulations

#### Configuration Partially Applied

- Some settings may require multiple reboots to fully take effect
- Channels in particular may need an extra reboot
- Power cycle the device completely (disconnect power/battery) and reconnect

#### "Invalid Configuration" Error

- Verify the backup YAML file is not corrupted
- Check that the backup is from a compatible firmware version
- Ensure the backup file follows proper YAML formatting
- Try restoring individual sections instead of the complete file

### Use Cases

#### Device Replacement

When replacing a failed device:
1. Restore your backup to the new device
2. The new device will have identical configuration
3. Channels and encryption keys will match your network
4. No manual reconfiguration needed

#### Multiple Identical Nodes

To deploy multiple nodes with the same configuration:
1. Configure one node as a template
2. Export its configuration
3. Edit the backup to change node name/ID for each device
4. Restore to each new device

#### Configuration Templates

Create backup templates for different use cases:
- `router-template.yaml` - Settings for infrastructure nodes
- `mobile-template.yaml` - Settings for handheld devices
- `sensor-template.yaml` - Settings for sensor nodes

#### Testing and Development

- Backup production configuration
- Test experimental settings
- Restore original config if tests fail
- No need to manually track settings changes
