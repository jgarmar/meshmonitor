## Quick Start

::: tip Need a Custom Configuration?
Use our **[Interactive Configurator](/configurator)** to generate a customized `docker-compose.yml` for your specific setup (TCP, BLE, Serial, reverse proxy, etc.).
:::

Get MeshMonitor running in under 60 seconds with Docker Compose:

```bash
cat > docker-compose.yml << 'EOF'
services:
  meshmonitor:
    image: ghcr.io/yeraze/meshmonitor:latest
    container_name: meshmonitor
    ports:
      - "8080:3001"
    volumes:
      - meshmonitor-data:/data
    environment:
      - MESHTASTIC_NODE_IP=192.168.1.100  # Change to your node's IP
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  meshmonitor-data:
EOF

docker compose up -d
```

Access at `http://localhost:8080` and login with username `admin` and password `changeme`.

**That's it!** No SESSION_SECRET or complex configuration needed for basic usage. MeshMonitor works over HTTP out of the box.

For production deployments, Kubernetes, reverse proxies, and advanced configurations, see the [Production Deployment Guide](/configuration/production).

## What is Meshtastic?

[Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/) is an open-source, off-grid, decentralized mesh network built on affordable, low-power devices. MeshMonitor provides a web-based interface to monitor and manage your Meshtastic network.

## Key Features

### Network Visualization
View your entire mesh network on an interactive map, with nodes colored by their signal strength and connectivity status. Track node positions, signal quality, and network topology in real-time.

### Message History
Access complete message history across all channels. Search, filter, and export messages for analysis or record-keeping.

### Node Management
Monitor individual node health, battery levels, environmental telemetry, and connection status. View detailed statistics for each node in your network.

### Channel Configuration
Manage multiple channels, view channel settings, and monitor message flow across different communication channels in your mesh.

### Security Monitoring
Automatically detect and flag nodes with security vulnerabilities. MeshMonitor identifies low-entropy (weak) encryption keys and duplicate keys shared across multiple nodes. Visual warnings and filtering options help you maintain a secure mesh network.

## Deployment Options

MeshMonitor supports multiple deployment scenarios:

- **Docker Compose**: Quick local deployment for testing and development
- **Kubernetes**: Production-ready deployment with Helm charts
- **Bare Metal**: Direct installation with Node.js for custom environments
